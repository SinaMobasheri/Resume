# Long Professional CV

## Description
This curriculum vitae template is clearly structured with bold centered category
names for each section. The descriptions of tasks for each job are in bullet
points. This template is conducive to longer CVs since there is no aesthetic
limit to how much information can be placed in each section. Would suit a
professional in the mid- to late-stage of their career.

Important note: The file "res.cls" is required to be in the same directory as
the template because the .tex file uses this custom class for structuring the
document.

## Authorship

Institute and has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
